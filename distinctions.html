        <h5>Dean of Science Book Prize 2017-2018</h3>
        <p>The Dean of Science Book Prize is awarded to a student from each of the eight departments offering undergraduate programs in the Faculty of Science.

     Each department forwards its nomination to the Dean of Science office, and the prizes are presented at the annual Faculty of Science Dean's Awards ceremony, held in September. 
     
     The Book Prize is awarded on the basis of demonstrated academic excellence in the declared major to a student who is not graduating in the academic year of the award.</p>

        <h5>Winning Team at Hacking Health, St. John's 2017</h3>
        <p>Hacking Health is a global annual Hackathon, and it made its first significant visit to the city of St. John's in 2017.
    For 48 hours, I worked along with my team on PatientMe: A web-app that we had the honour to present to Newfoundland's Minister of Health after his invitation.
    PatientMe focuses on helping the public find their healthcare through smart matchmaking with available Doctors.
    The demo also utilized tools such as the Google Maps API and Google Translate, to allow patients to easily find and navigate to their desired doctor, while eliminating linguistic boundaries.</p>
